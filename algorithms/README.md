# Writng Algorithms

Applied to code, an algorithm is just a function that transforms a certain input data structure into a certain output data structure. The logic inside decides the transformation.

First and foremost, the inputs and outputs should clearly be defined, ideally, as unit tests. This requires fully understanding the problem at hand, which is not to be underestimated, because a thorough analysis of the problem can surface the solution naturally, without needing to write any code.

Once the problem domain is thoroughly grasped, brainstorming of the solution space can begin. What variables will be needed? How many loops and what kinds? Are there any clever built-in methods that can help? Edge cases to consider? Complex or repeated logic can be difficult to read and understand. 

Can helper functions be extracted or abstracted? An algorithm usually needs to be scalable. As input sizes grow, how will the function perform? Should there be some kind of caching mechanisms? Generally, memory optimizations (space) will need to be sacrificed for performance gains (time).

Finally, think about re-factoring and modularising at a stage

## Types of Algorithms

To assist in the calculus of runtime complexities, we approximate the scalability of an algorithm by extrapolating its input sizes toward infinity (passing signatures/parameters) before counting the number of operations required.

At this worst-case runtime upper bound, we can drop coefficients and additive terms, retaining only factors that dominate the function. The most optimum algorithm scales in constant time and space. This means it does not care at all about the growth of its inputs.

```
Constant: O(1)

Logarithmic: O(log n)

Linear: O(n)

Linearithmic: O(n log n)

Quadratic: O(nÂ²)

Expontential: O(2^n)

Factorial: O(n!)
