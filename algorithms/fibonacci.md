# Working with Fibonacci sequences

Let’s describe a test case for our Fibonacci function - fib(). Taking a short Fibonacci sequence say: 
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21] and fib(4), the result would be equal to 3, so basically we need to return
an element with index 4 from our Fibonacci sequence array.

One possible and probably the easiest solution that comes to mind here is iteration. Let’s see how it would look:

Solution:

Notice that two first numbers can not really be effectively generated by a for loop, because our 
loop will involve adding two numbers together, so instead of creating an empty array we assign 
our arr variable to [0, 1] that we know for a fact will always be there. After that we create a loop 
that starts iterating from i = 2 and adds numbers to the array until the length of the array is equal to n + 1. 

Finally, we return the number at n index of array.
```
function  fib(n){
	
	let arr = [0, 1]

	for(let i = 2, i < n+1, i++){
		arr.push(arr[n - 2] + arr[n-1])
	}
	return arr[n]
}

fib(4)//will return 33
```
