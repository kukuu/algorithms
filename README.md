## Beat the Computer!

This is  a web application GAME - Rock, Paper, Scissors, using vanilla JavaScript with best practices. Including es6 and some new  JavaScript API objects.

This game has been engineered to be played against the Computer. 

You can read more on the game from here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock–paper–scissors. 

Note, the semantics  in descriptive names of the caching variables for the DOM elements.

The application's JavaScript document is versioned, and documented to reflect the iterations going on in building the application.

Enjoy!
